## Smart Traffic Management using Scilab

# Overview

This project implements a Smart Traffic Management System using Scilab. The goal is to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and simulate intelligent signal control using computational models.

# Features

The Smart Traffic Light Control System using Image Processing aims to enhance pedestrian 
safety and improve traffic flow by dynamically adjusting traffic light timings based on 
realtime traffic density. Utilizing the Canny Edge Detection Technique, this system efficiently 
reduces pedestrian wait times at crossings. By eliminating the need for traditional hardware 
sensors and using image processing, this method offers a cost-effective and user-friendly 
solution for traffic management. The system's effectiveness is demonstrated across varying 
traffic conditions, showcasing its potential to revolutionize urban traffic control
